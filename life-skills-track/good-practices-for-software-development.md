## Which point(s) were new to you?
- Write down all the questions you have and send it as a single message.
- Do not miss calls. If you cannot talk immediately, receive the call and inform them you will call in back in 5-10 min, and call them back. This is a much better alternative than letting it go down as a missed call.

## Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
